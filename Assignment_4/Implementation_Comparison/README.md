Extra on this assignment:
	- Implemented the assignment using both singly and doubly linked lists
	- Ensured both tests have no memory leaks
	- Wrote a shell script to run the two tests side-by-side for comparisons sake

To run:
	- In EXTRA WORK folder (this folder), run make
	- Open alltests.sh and modify the directory to where you'd like test files to be stored
	- Run all alltests.sh
	- Observe how slow the singly linked implementation is in comparison
